Our project presents an alternative approach in doing matrix multiplications. As of now, matrix multiplication or most of the numerical calculations are done by digital computers. Digital computers takes a noticeable time when calculating large volume numerical calculations. But in our analog electronics based approach, the computation time could be reduced drastically.
