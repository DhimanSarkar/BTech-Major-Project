This approach could find its way to every scientific applications because of its real-time numerical ability. In particular AI/ML is a great area for the application of this technique. Real-time object detection, speach recognition could be useful for the differently-able persons. This can also help to take instant decisions based on objective measures and could thousands of lives.

In addition to this, a full fledged Analog Processing Unit which can do other mathematical calculations than just matrix multiplication such as solving partial differential equations could revolutionize the numerical methods and computational power.
